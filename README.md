# Rafael (Rafa) Lopes
I am a physicist interested in time-series analysis, mathematical epidemiology, data science for epidemiology, and the impacts of climate change on epidemics. I'm very active on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/rafalpx.bsky.social)

I hold a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics at the Institute for Theoretical Physics - [IFT](https://www.ift.unesp.br/#!/en) (in Portuguese) of the State University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. After defending my Ph.D. I become a postdoctoral researcher at [All for Health Institute](https://www.itps.org.br/quem-somos/en), a newly founded institute to help and build capacity in Brazil on curbing and mitigating the effects of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. I am currently a postdoctoral associate researcher at [Grubaugh Lab](http://grubaughlab.com/) and [Carlson Lab](https://www.carlsonlab.bio/), modeling climate change impact in infectious diseases such as Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika while doing health attribution.

My thesis title is "Dengue dynamics under climate drivers: Analysis with ecological and epidemiological frameworks", an analysis and data analysis of how temperature and precipitation have affected the dynamics of Dengue in Brazil over 10 years, 2010-2019. To know more, please, visit the thesis website [here](https://rafalopespx.github.io/phd_slides_defense).

During the pandemic, together with collaborators, we founded a civil society and scientific research group to bring to the public debate the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil analysis and news. Our site is [covid19br.github.io](https://covid19br.github.io) and our institutional profile [github.com/covid19br](https://github.com/covid19br/) in github. We had active profiles on all social media, all are @obscovid19br. [Twitter](twitter.cm/obscovid19br), [Instagram](instagram.com/obscovid19br), [Facebook](facebook.com/obscovid19br).

I do Science communication, mainly in Portuguese:
