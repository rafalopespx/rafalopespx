I am a Physicist with an interest in time-series analysis, mathematical epidemiology, data science for epidemiology, and the impacts of climate change on epidemics. I'm very active on [Twitter](twitter.com/rafalpx)

I am a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics at the Institute for Theoretical Physics - [IFT](https://www.ift.unesp.br/#!/en) (in Portuguese) of the State University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. After defending my Ph.D. I was a postdoctoral researcher at [All for health Institute](https://www.itps.org.br/quem-somos/en), a newly founded institute to help and build capacity in Brazil on curbing and mitigating the effects of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. I am a postdoctoral associate researcher at [Grubaugh Lab](http://grubaughlab.com/), researching methods to nowcasting SARS-CoV-2 variants succession and its impact on infections.

My thesis title is "Dengue dynamics under climate drivers: Analysis with ecological and epidemiological frameworks", an analysis and data analysis of how temperature and precipitation have been affecting the dynamics of Dengue in Brazil over the last 10 years, 2010-2019. To know more, please, visit the thesis website [here](https://rafalopespx.github.io/phd_slides_defense).

Since March 2020, together with my Ph.D. advisor and collaborators, we founded a website and NGO to bring to the public debate the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil scientifically updated analysis and news. Our site is [covid19br.github.io](https://covid19br.github.io) and our institutional profile [github.com/covid19br](https://github.com/covid19br/) in github. We have profiles on all social media, all are @obscovid19br. [Twitter](twitter.cm/obscovid19br), [Instagram](instagram.com/obscovid19br), [Facebook](facebook.com/obscovid19br).

I like very much data visualization! There are some repositories that I've been working on projects for Dataviz:

- Cell Towers over South America, [here](https://github.com/rafalopespx/cell_towers_south_america)

- [Sporadic](https://github.com/rafalopespx/Artes/) dataviz projects: 
    - a [chlropeth map](https://github.com/rafalopespx/Artes/tree/main/chlropleth) for São Paulo city and its inequalities 
    - a [randomic distribution of points over the Brazil map](https://github.com/rafalopespx/Artes/tree/main/points_over_brazil) extent representing all life lost to the pandemic. [not updated]


Sometimes I writte Science communication text, mainly on the [Blogs Unicamp](https://www.blogs.unicamp.br/covid-19/), all text are written in Portuguese:

  - [O "fim" da história e o Homem final](https://www.blogs.unicamp.br/covid-19/o-fim-da-historia-e-o-homem-final/)
  - [600 dias e um desabafo: as pessoas são sempre maiores que as estatísticas](https://www.blogs.unicamp.br/covid-19/600-dias-e-um-desabafo-as-pessoas-sao-sempre-maiores-que-as-estatisticas/)
  - [Ciência, o que é e como utilizar: receitas práticas para uma pandemia moderna](https://www.blogs.unicamp.br/covid-19/ciencia-o-que-e-e-como-utilizar/)
