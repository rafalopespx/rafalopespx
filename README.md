I am a Physicist with interest in time-series analysis, mathematical epidemiology, data science for epidemiology and impacts of climate change on epidemics. I'm very active on [Twitter](twitter.com/rafalpx)

I am a Ph.D Candidate in Theoretical Physics at the Institute for Theoretical Physics - [IFT](https://www.ift.unesp.br/#!/en) (in Portuguese) of São Paulo State University, São Paulo, Brazil

Since March 2020, together with my Ph.D. advisor and collaborators we founded a website and NGO, to bring to the public debate of Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil, scientifically updated analysis and news. Our site is [covid19br.github.io](https://covid19br.github.io) and our institutional is [profile](https://github.com/covid19br/) in github. We have profiles in all social medias, all are @obscovid19br. [Twitter](twitter.cm/obscovid19br), [Instagram](instagram.com/obscovid19br), [Facebook](facebook.com/obscovid19br).

I Like very much data visualization! There are some repositories that I've been working on projects for dataviz:

- Cell Towers over South America, [here](https://github.com/rafalopespx/cell_towers_south_america)

- [Sporadic](https://github.com/rafalopespx/Artes/) dataviz projects: 
    - a [chlropeth map](https://github.com/rafalopespx/Artes/tree/main/chlropleth) for São Paulo city and its inequalities 
    - a [randomic distribution of points over the Brazil map](https://github.com/rafalopespx/Artes/tree/main/points_over_brazil) extent representing all life lost to the pandemic, its it not updated.


Sometimes I writte Science communication text, mainly on the [Blogs Unicamp](https://www.blogs.unicamp.br/covid-19/), all text are written in Portuguese:

  - [O "fim" da história e o Homem final](https://www.blogs.unicamp.br/covid-19/o-fim-da-historia-e-o-homem-final/)
  - [600 dias e um desabafo: as pessoas são sempre maiores que as estatísticas](https://www.blogs.unicamp.br/covid-19/600-dias-e-um-desabafo-as-pessoas-sao-sempre-maiores-que-as-estatisticas/)
  - [Ciência, o que é e como utilizar: receitas práticas para uma pandemia moderna](https://www.blogs.unicamp.br/covid-19/ciencia-o-que-e-e-como-utilizar/)
