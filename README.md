I am a Physicist with interest in time-series analysis, mathematical epidemiology and impacts of climate change on epidemics.

I am a Ph.D Candidate in Theoretical Physics at the Institute for Theoretical Physics - [IFT](https://www.ift.unesp.br/#!/en) (in Portuguese) of São Paulo State University, São Paulo, Brazil

Since March 2020, together with my advisor and collaborators I founded a website and NGO to give to the public debate of Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil, scientifically updated analysis and news, our site [covid19br.github.io](https://covid19br.github.io) and our institutional [profile](https://github.com/covid19br/) in github. We have profiles in all social medias, @obscovid19br
