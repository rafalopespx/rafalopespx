# Rafael (Rafa) Lopes
I am a Physicist interested in time-series analysis, mathematical & statistical epidemiology, data science for epidemiology, and the impacts of climate change on epidemics.

I am a postdoctoral associate researcher at [Grubaugh Lab](https://grubaughlab.com/team/rafael-lopes/), researching methods to integrate SARS-CoV-2 genomics and epidemiological data into nowcasting and forecasting pipelines.

I hold a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics at the Institute for Theoretical Physics - [IFT](https://www.ift.unesp.br/#!/en) (in Portuguese) of the State University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. After defending my Ph.D. I was a postdoctoral researcher at [All for health Institute](https://www.itps.org.br/quem-somos/en), a newly founded institute to help and build capacity in Brazil on curbing and mitigating the effects of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. 

My thesis title is "Dengue dynamics under climate drivers: Analysis with ecological and epidemiological frameworks", an analysis and data analysis of how temperature and precipitation have been affecting the dynamics of Dengue in Brazil over the last 10 years, 2010-2019. To know more, please, visit the thesis website [here](https://rafalopespx.github.io/phd_slides_defense).

During the pandemic, together with my Ph.D. advisor and collaborators, we founded a website and NGO to bring to the public debate the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil scientifically updated analysis and news. Our site is [covid19br.github.io](https://covid19br.github.io) and our institutional profile [github.com/covid19br](https://github.com/covid19br/) in github. We have profiles on all social media, all are @obscovid19br.
